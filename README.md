# Hashmap_projet
This is the code for the gestion of a HashMap<br>
You have to compile my program with the command "make" in the terminal.<br>
When the compilation is done you will have an executable, a documentation and a static library.<br>
For the documentation, you just have to launch html/index.html in a browser. You will find an explanation for every function and structure.<br>
You can execute my program with the command : "./exx"<br>
Once launched, the program wil ask you if you want to fill the hashmap automaticaly or manualy.<br>
Manualy, you will have the choice between 5 functions :  <br>
<strong>
1 : add a new pair<br>
2 : delete a pair<br>
3 : modify a value<br>
4 : get the size of the Hashmap<br>
5 : get the value of a selected key<br>
</strong>
 And when you are done, you just have to enter 0 to finish the program and delete the hashmap<br>
